# CC3Kgame
ChamberCrawler3000, a text-based rogue-like dungeon crawler game. Final project of CS246. The project instructions and game mechanics details are contained in the "Instructions.pdf" file. However, given the amount of details, a summary of the main mechanics is provided below (not yet available, in progress).

Note that some features have not been implemented yet. Notably, the random generation of the map is still being worked on. As such, after compiling the game into an executable, it should be run with a string specifying the name of a .txt file containing the map layout. A sample map is provided in the "cc3kfloor copy.txt" file. Without this command-line argument, the game will instead randomly generate a map, which as mentioned, is a feature that has yet to be implemented.
